# MyWatchList

MyWatchList is an android app that gives the user the option to make his own watch-list.
The user chooses a movie from an external list, adds description and date to it and adds it to his watch-list.
In the watch-list the user can add more items, delete and also edit them.
The app uses OMDB-api, Retrofit, Room library, Dagger Hilt module, MVVM architecture and many more aspects.
